    <p>On line 53, when I was writing my last if...else statement, my linter kept yelling at me about not having a semicolon between the closing parenthesis and the open curly bracket.
      The only way that I could get that linter error to go away was to make this an else if statement. Can you PLEASE tell me why this happened? I don't see any rouge
      brackets or unclosed parenthesis</p>
